Readme file for Project 1 of the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree, Version 1.0 March 26 2014

This project creates a website to store my favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL), a YouTube link to the movie trailer, who stars in the movie, and the movie rating.

There are 3 programs associated with this project.  All 3 projects should be stored in the same folder to run properly.

The 3 programs are:

1) media3 - this program creates a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) for the movie attributes.  This movie attributes are:
	*movie title, 
	*box art URL (or poster URL), 
	*a YouTube link to the movie trailer, 
	*who stars in the movie, and 
	*the movie rating.

2) entertainment_center3 - creates multiple instances of the Python Class to represent my favorite movies; 
3) fresh_tomatoes2 - a Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py was generously provided by Udacity.  This module generates the website that displays these movies. 	Along with a this module is a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which 		visualizes all of my favorite movies. 
	This module was modified slightly to customize the website with additional movie information such as who stars in the movie and the movie ratings. Then 	renamed fresh_tomatoes2.
